### Background

Mainly, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd requires assistance with its customer and transactional data. The company possesses a sizable dataset concerning its customers, yet its team is uncertain about the most effective approach to analyze it for optimizing their marketing strategy.

To facilitate this analysis, you consulted with the Associate Director, who emphasized the critical role of enhancing the quality of customer datasets. She underscored, "The significance of optimizing the quality of customer datasets cannot be overstated. The higher the quality of the dataset, the greater the likelihood of using it to drive company growth."

The client has furnished KPMG with three datasets:

1.Customer Demographic
2.Customer Addresses
3.Transactional data from the past three months

### Solutions

1. Accuracy: Ensuring the presence of correct values.
2. Completeness: Verifying the presence of values in all relevant fields.
3. Consistency: Confirming that values are devoid of contradictions.
4. Currency: Ensuring that values are up-to-date.
5. Relevancy: Evaluating the relevance of metadata.
6. Validity: Verifying the legitimacy of values.
7. Uniqueness: Ensuring that records are distinct and not duplicated.

## Task 2 Business insight and development plans

### Background

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a longstanding KPMG client specializing in high-quality bikes and cycling accessories, seeks to enhance business through a strategic analysis of their customer dataset. Utilizing three existing datasets—Customer Demographic, Customer Address, and Transactions—labeled as the dataset, we aim to recommend which among the 1000 new customers should be targeted for maximum organizational value.

To initiate this process, a comprehensive approach will be outlined in a PowerPoint presentation. The agreed-upon three-week scope encompasses Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation as the key phases. The detailed plan includes activities such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, and results interpretation, all culminating in a report. The proposed steps will be presented to the client for approval before commencing the analysis.

### Solution

The presentation included an overview of customer distribution, financial insights, and an elaboration on the subsequent business plan aimed at recommending potential customers.

## Task 3 Data visualization and interactive dashboard

### Background

Utilizing visualizations like interactive dashboards is instrumental in emphasizing significant discoveries and expressing our concepts more concisely. A mere roster of customers or algorithmic output may not suffice for the client; we must reinforce our findings through the application of visual aids.

### Solution

Power BI has been chosen as the designated visualization tool for showcasing the interactive dashboard. Additionally, the identification of 1000 potential customers was achieved through a combination of clustering and the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) score methodology.
